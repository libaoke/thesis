  abstract = {Quorum systems serve as a basic tool providing a uniform and reliable
	way to achieve coordination in a distributed system. They are useful
	for distributed and replicated databases, name servers, mutual exclusion,
	and distributed access control and signatures. The un-availability
	of a quorum system is the probability of the event that no live quorum
	exists in the system. When such an event occurs the service is completely
	halted. The un-availability is widely accepted as the measure by
	which quorum systems are evaluated. In this paper we characterize
	the optimal availability quorum system in the general case, when
	the failure probabilities may take any value in the range 0 &lt;
	pi &lt; 1. Then we deal with the practical scenario in which the
	failure probabilities are unknown, but can be estimated. We give
	a robust and efficient algorithm that calculates a near optimal quorum
	system based on the estimated failure probabilities. },
